Ever touched anything? Felt its texture? Maybe your mind formed an impression of the texture of the subject while you were “feeling” it, but, if by ‘touching’ you mean having contact of your fingers with the other object, then, you are mistaken. You did not touch it. In fact you have never touched anything in your whole lifetime. This might come to you as a shock, but, give it some time and think about it.

Two atoms never touch each other, except when they are chemically bonded. There is high electrostatic repulsion when two atoms come close together. This force is inversely proportional to the distance between them(squared). Thus, if they approach each other then the distance between them decreases and the repulsion increases. In chemical reactions, nuclear force comes into play and it neutralizes or overcomes the repulsion. Otherwise when the distance tends to zero(total touch), the repulsion reaches infinity.

Thus, a pure physical touch is not feasible. What is possible is merely a sensation of contact due to detected pressure from that object.

Enjoy a somewhat changed mind!
