Today morning from 09:30 to 10:30 was my examination of the subject ‘Digital Image Processing’.

Yesterday when I was studying for today’s test, upon seeing the ‘j’, denoting complex values (which I had learned in my senior secondary days as ‘i’), I remembered what a friend of mine, who took biology in class 11th, asked me a few weeks back.

He had asked, “Hey, you guys (who took mathematics then) used to study that thing with i (he meant complex numbers) and dy/dx and so many things. Are they of any use now? I don’t think those things have any practical application.” I had a very hard time trying to explain to him that all those things are very integral parts of engineering and that engineering is more that what he meant by ‘practical application’. Back then in class 11th, he had to learn a little bit of calculus for his Physics classes, and he did not like this at all.

The problem was that he had no idea of any application of what he was learning. Of course, the immediate application of differentiation was to calculate the acceleration of a particle with the given function of its velocity, but to him this was not a practical example. Why and where the hell in my life will I get this function of velocity, he would say. He might have needed to know some scenarios where those things would be useful for him, and frankly, there were none!

This I think is the biggest problem in education today. We are providing abstract education to the students. They know what they are studying but a very tiny fraction of them knows why they are studying it. This is the ‘Bottom-up’ approach to teaching. Here the students miss the forest for the tree. They spend a lot of time on the subjects which they will probably never use in their life (like my biology friend). Even if he gets a related problem it will not be worth what he went through studying them in detail. And when he really gets the problem it will be much easier for him to learn then, as he will have a clear picture of what he wants and how the process and steps are helping him gradually solve his problem.

What I am proposing is a somewhat top-down approach where we show the students what is desired and then show them the steps to go there and then describe the steps in detail. An even better situation is when the student encounters a problem and then starts to study its solution and take the help of the experts to learn the steps involved. This process will save a huge amount of time wasted in learning things unnecessary to us which we soon forget.

Calculate the time it took you to go through those secondary year school and senior secondary and then graduation, then post-graduation, and so on. If any person wants to study all which you remember now, don’t you think that it will take much less time than you? And why will he even care to do so? He does not need all of that, same as you do not need all of that.
