Some time ago, I used to go restless when I had nothing to do. I used to check facebook timeline, instagram feed, whatsapp messeges, then the statuses of all these platforms, then again its feeds, then some youtube and this would go on. I wanted to consume as much as I could. 

Then my phone broke and I had to live without a smartphone for a few weeks. I had nothing to do in my free time except sitting idle and thinking about myriad of things. I would just sit and let my mind wander. Then to my surprise ideas started coming to me. Varieties to them. Of every kind. From those experiences I derived a process (sort of), which I am sharing with you.

The first thing you need to believe is that your mind has unlimited possibility for generation of ideas. If you believe it then anything is possible from here. The process which I apply for idea generation is quiet simple. And to be clear about myself, I have not applied this technique to generate ideas related to any specific topic, but rather a general idea, just regarding anything under the sun. 

Let’s talk about the process itself. Clear off any unfinished work and then sit in a quiet place. You do not need to have any noting materials nearby. Just sit empty handed. And clear your head. Just clear it. Think Nothing. 

Human mind is pretty restless mind. It’s attention span is nearly 7 seconds.  Your mind does not like to sit idle. It likes to jump around and it will prevent you from focusing it by going to unimaginable limits. When you try to clear your mind and focus on only one thing, it will feed you some random stuffs to distract you from focusing. Beware now! If you are baited then it is over. But if you persist then the game goes on. It will throw into your attention some interesting thing or idea. It goes on like this. The longer you persist the more interesting things your mind will hunt for you. And everything is in your mind, you should believe it. 

My only advise to you is that do not get carried away with the initial offerings of your brain. It has brilliant stuffs buried deep within it. You just need to irritate it enough by (ironically) calming it so that it reveals its secrets.

This process works for me most of the time. But even if it does not work, my mind is more calm than before and I can now focus on things a bit longer. I have nothing to lose and plenty to gain from this process.

Fun Fact: I got the idea that this activity can be a ‘Idea Manufacturing’ process during one of these mind hunts itself.
