_ॐ पूर्णमदः पूर्णमिदं पूर्णात् पूर्णमुदच्यते। पूर्णस्य पूर्णमादाय पूर्णमेवावशिष्यते॥_

_That is complete, This is complete, from (that) complete emerges (this) complete. On separation of (this) complete from (that) complete, complete only remains._

This is from  वृहदारण्यक उपनिषद (vrihadaaranyak upanishad). In this context, I think, ‘that’ refers to God and ‘this’ refers to us. Let us not go into that. Just look at the logic here. I used to wonder how can this be. How on removing something from something complete can leave it complete? 

Yesterday, I was going through George Gamaw’s ‘One Two Three … Infinity’. In there he has explained how to deal with infinities and how to compare them. There he has concluded that: 

_In the world of infinity, a part may be equal to the whole!_

This may seem illogical to you same way the ‘mantra’ is sounding illogical. But let us delve into logic here. 

Many Hottentot tribes in Africa do not have names for numbers larger than three (According to Gamaw’s book). If they have to refer to a number greater than three, they use a word like “many” in their language. Now if they want to know which of them in their neighborhood has more children, can they do that? 

Let’s say there are two Hottentots who has 7 and 10 children respectively. They do not know how to count beyond 3. How will they compare? If they are intelligent they can get the answer by comparing them one by one. They will place one child of one with the one child of other and another child of one with another child of another and so on. They will know who has more child when some children of anyone remains after pairing with children of the others.

In a similar way, while dealing with the infinities, we become analogous to the Hottentots. So for comparing infinities we should proceed in the similar fashion, i.e. by comparing the individual items. 

Let us have an example for this. 

We know that the total number of integers is infinite. We also know that total number of even numbers is also infinite. Now, if I ask you which among these two infinities is larger then your impression would be that the even numbers’ infinity is smaller and that of integers is larger. But let’s not go with the impression and follow the process here. 

We have to compare the elements one by one. Lets do that. Here I am mapping integers to the corresponding even number.

1 : 2, 2 : 4, 3 : 6, 4 : 8, 5 : 10, 6 : 12, … , 101 : 202, … , 1012 : 2024, …

This can go on and on and on. So for every integer we have an even number. Thus we must conclude that both the infinities are equal, even if this goes against our impressions. It is because the properties of the infinity is different than normal.

This is what I understood in the book and it immediately connected the dots for me. I instantly remembered this verse which mean almost the same thing. Maybe it suggests that we too are infinite. Maybe it suggests we are whole on our own. Maybe it suggests Everyone is as complete as God himself. I don’t know. Maybe.
