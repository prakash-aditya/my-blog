Aditya Prakash is currently working as a Software Engineer at FactSet Research Systems. He likes reading and exploring new things. Mention a new technology or a good book and he will try to know know about it more as soon as he can. Although he doen't finish up all that he starts, still the habit lets him increase his breadth of knowledge which he considers to be his goal for this life.

Being an introvert, he also likes to spend thinking and speculating about all sorts of things, from software engineering to quantum physics, from astronomy to philosophy. This blog is an attempt to put his thoughts into words for the world to benefit and for himself too (lest he forgets about the idea, haha!)
