I had to prepare for the entrance exam of Ramakrishna Mission Vidyapith for class 6. In Muzaffarpur, where I prepared for that competition in the coaching(yes, there are coachings for preparation of entrance examinations of various schools such as Military School, Sainik Schools, Navoday Vidyalaya , R K Mission, etc), these examinations are taken quite seriously.</p><p>My teachers, in order to motivate us, used to say, “Work hard for a few months, and then after the selection, your life is set!”.</p><p>They lied, I believed.</p><p>I cracked that exam and was admitted to RK Mission vidyapith deoghar. Life was still not set. The same life went on. Same classes, same exams, same expectations of better results. Anyhow, I came to class 10th. My parents said, “This is where your real test is. It will show what you have studied in these 10 years. Work hard and get good results now. Life will be great.”</p><p>They lied, I believed.</p><p>I got 10 CGPA in 10th and everybody was happy for some days as long as people kept asking my 10th board results. Life was normal afterward. I went to class 11th. Now I was told - “Work hard these two years, these results will be with you your lifetime.” I remember my Mamaji saying after my 10th result, “This is not the actual exam. The real exam is in 12th”. Everyone said, “Just get a good result in 12th and your life is set!”.</p><p>They lied, I believed.</p><p>I got 95.6% in 12th board. Then I went to Kota for JEE preparation. Everyone went real crazy this time, “This is the most important year in your life. This one year of preparation will make you or break you. This is the exam that can make your life.” I was now slowly recognizing the pattern here.</p><p>Still, they lied, I believed.</p><p>I got admitted to the National Institute of Technology, Jamshedpur. You can predict here, not so hard work was done. When I entered college, my subconscious might have known that probably this is the great life everyone was pointing to. I began to enjoy. No attention to any classes. Just doing what I felt like. Bunking classes. You won’t believe, I got 2 marks out of 20 in maths in T1(our first examination there). Anyhow, I got 7.76 CGPA in my first semester.</p><p>My parents kept reminding me that these four years are the most important years of my life and I should work hard as they will decide my whole life after college. I assured them that I was working very hard.</p><p>This time, I lied, they believed.</p><p>In the 3rd semester, I just passed in Mathematics, a subject which I used to love. I used to study only days before exams. One thing I did really well was to study programming because I liked it. I love computer science, but could not get into that department due to insufficient JEE rank. Anyhow, these four years have passed, quite easily and I did what I wished, literally! Now, I have a Software Engineering job and this vacation is about to end.</p><p>One thing that I have learned from this whole process is that ‘the set life’ is never going to come at any specific point in your life. You shall have to keep looking and keep moving towards it. But, it is not that you should not work hard. You should labor hard for the sake of work. Not keeping in mind that your life will be easier afterward.</p><p>You need to find easiness in your lifestyle with work. Because Life is Labour, Death only is rest.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/authors/aditya-prakash/" class="invert" rel="author">Aditya Prakash</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at FactSet Research Systems. I like reading and exploring new things. Mention a new technology or a good book and I will try to know know about it more as soon as I can. Although I doen't usually finish all that I start, still the habit lets me increase my breadth of knowledge which I considers to be his goal for this life.<br><br>Being an introvert, I also like to spend thinking and speculating about all sorts of things, from software engineering to quantum physics, from astronomy to philosophy. This blog is an attempt to put my thoughts into words for the world to benefit and for myself too (lest I forget about the idea, haha!)</p><ul class="contact"><li class="icon solid fa-envelope">mail@aditya-prakash.com</li><li class="icon solid fa-home">India</li></ul></section><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
