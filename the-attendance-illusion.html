It is not the result only of my personal effort. It is the result of the combined efforts of many, the least of which is of my professors. Their only contribution to my degree is that they evaluated my answer sheets, took my attendance, and kept reminding every now and then that one with short attendance will be facing consequences.</p><p>The attendance system is there to force the students to attend the classes. It is in place to prevent casual bunking of classes by students. But this is at a greater cost, which we are failing to realize (or admit). Why are we forced to sit in a class which does not interest us at all? Is it just because I opted for that branch of study? I did not know that these subjects would seem so boring back then when I had applied. Now that I am on the verge of exiting the education system here, It seems to me that the subjects are not boring themselves. No subject can be boring.</p><p><em>If you find science boring, you are learning it from a wrong teacher. - Richard Feynman</em></p><p>And things become worse when you force someone to sit through the boring times. From this boredom comes the hatred for the subject. After this, it will be very hard for his interest in the subject to grow (even by any Good teacher).</p><p>Except if some discussion has to be held in the class, it is utter nonsense to force the student to sit just to listen to the teacher. Especially in this tech-era where even the teachers know that lectures better than theirs are available online. The students should be free to use the materials online or attend the lectures of his teacher, whichever fits them most, and take the help of the teachers to clarify any doubt. This way, even the teachers would elevate their standards, who at present don’t give a damn about the teaching methodology as they know the students will anyway attend. Accepting this attendance system is same as accepting mediocrity.</p><p>The biggest misunderstanding of the implementers of the ‘Minimum required attendance percentage’ must be that the students who attend the class study during that time and the students who do not attend the class do not study. While this system has managed to satisfy almost everyone that Education is happening, all it has really done is to prepare and nurture students who study only for the sake of examinations and then forget everything after the exams are over.</p><p>This system definitely needs to change and it will change gradually as more and more students are being churned out of this culprit factory who will soon realize that they had been wasting their time all along attending those lectures.</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/authors/aditya-prakash/" class="invert" rel="author">Aditya Prakash</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at FactSet Research Systems.
