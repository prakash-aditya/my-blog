The indian audience filled the social media with memes.</p><blockquote><p>Herogiri foo foo karne mein nahi, thoo thoo karne mein hai.</p></blockquote><p>Older videos of Akshay kumar boasting that many companies come to him with unimaginable amounts to do some ads but he would never do anything that impacts the health of people. Obviously the clip ended with a short clip from the recent Ad (Bolo Zubaan kesari).</p><p>This went on so much so that Akshay Kumar issued an apology to his fans about doing it and promised to be careful from now on while taking endorsements.</p><hr><h4 id="possible-psychology-of-pitfall">Possible psychology of pitfall</h4><p><strong>1. You are the easiest person to be fooled by yourself</strong></p><p>When it comes to fooling yourself, it is very easy to do so. When Akshay signed the contract, it must have seemed to him that he was not doing anything wrong in endorsing Vimal Elaichi.</p><p><strong>2. Money makes you weak in proportion to amount offered</strong></p><p>It is even easier to fool yourself when a huge amount of money is offered. These offers outweigh any negatives you had in your mind.</p><hr><h4 id="issue">Issue</h4><p><strong>I highly appreciate Akshay Kumar’s gesture of apologizing and I think it was a very brave decision.</strong></p><p>Although he apologized, he sneaked in the info that he was not intending any harm to anyone and was only doing the ad for Elaichi and not the paan masaala. The same logic has been given by Ajay Devgn earlier and even now when asked after Akshay’s apology.</p><h4 id="debunking-the-logic">Debunking the logic</h4><p>I dont think that he had no idea of existence of Vimal Paan Masaala. I think it is the Vimal Paan Masala division that is sponsoring the Ads on behalf of the Elaichi (if they are separate divisions) with three so called Bollywood Superstars, because I don’t think the botton line (profit) of Vimal Elaichi could sponsor those three. If I can see this then Obviously they must know this, or at least their team must be capable of this research, if needed. Even then they thought that they are not endoring paan masaala, and what’s wrong in endorsing Elaichi!</p><p>This type of Ad will profit the Vimal Paan Masaala more than the Elaichi. So, one could not be free from the moral obligation just by mentioning that they are doing the Elaichi Ad, not the paan masaala one.</p><h4 id="solution">Solution</h4><p>Watching the ads affects your subconscious. Even if you consciously know that it is just an ad and it might or might not be true - mostly not true. Even then due to the impressions on your subconscious mind, you tend to choose this when given option.</p><h5 id="controlled-ads-impossible">Controlled Ads (impossible)</h5><p>It would be great if I could control what ads I’ll not see. I could turn the ads off for companies I don’t want to see ads for.</p><p>But this will never be possible because companies pay higher ad fee to platforms to forcibly show their ads to people. Consider non-skippable ads on youtube. Controlled ads would lower the revenue for the showing platforms, hence lower possibility for its implementation.</p><h5 id="associate-negative-image-possible">Associate negative image (possible)</h5><p>This will require training your own brain to ignore the importance of those ads. This can be achieved by lowering the importance of the celebrities involved in these types of ads.</p><p>You could Associate a negative image to that celebrity whenever you see that ad you didn’t want to see. Recall the same image whenever you see that celebrity in a film or whatever their work, recall that they have been doing unwanted ads just for money and not caring about the well being of the countrymen.</p><p>Doing this will lower their importance in your mind and your subconscious wont see that person as someone important or Hero. When this starts happening in some time of practice, you’ll see that ads wont affect you.</p><h5 id="notice-the-details-possible-and-interesting">Notice the details (possible and interesting)</h5><p>Look into the ads as if they have been crafted just to impress you. Pay attention to the details. See how shiny the things in the ad are. Notice how modulating the voice is. Notice they have put music piece in the background just to delude your mind in thinking that this is an interesting thing.</p><p>When you train your mind for these things, you’ll see you start to enjoy the ads too, and that too without letting them get into your brain.</p><hr><hr><p>For any feedback or further discussions, please reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-aditya/">LinkedIn</a> or <a href="mailto:&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#64;&#x61;&#100;&#105;&#x74;&#121;&#97;&#45;&#112;&#x72;&#x61;&#x6b;&#x61;&#115;&#104;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;">&#109;&#x61;&#105;&#x6c;&#64;&#x61;&#100;&#105;&#x74;&#121;&#97;&#45;&#112;&#x72;&#x61;&#x6b;&#x61;&#115;&#104;&#46;&#99;&#111;&#x6d;</a></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/authors/aditya-prakash/" class="invert" rel="author">Aditya Prakash</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at FactSet Research Systems. I like reading and exploring new things. Mention a new technology or a good book and I will try to know know about it more as soon as I can. Although I doen't usually finish all that I start, still the habit lets me increase my breadth of knowledge which I considers to be his goal for this life.<br><br>Being an introvert, I also like to spend thinking and speculating about all sorts of things, from software engineering to quantum physics, from astronomy to philosophy. This blog is an attempt to put my thoughts into words for the world to benefit and for myself too (lest I forget about the idea, haha!)</p><ul class="contact"><li class="icon solid fa-envelope">mail@aditya-prakash.com</li><li class="icon solid fa-home">India</li></ul></section><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
