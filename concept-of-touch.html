Felt its texture? Maybe your mind formed an impression of the texture of the subject while you were “feeling” it, but, if by ‘touching’ you mean having contact of your fingers with the other object, then, you are mistaken. You did not touch it. In fact you have never touched anything in your whole lifetime. This might come to you as a shock, but, give it some time and think about it.</p><p>Two atoms never touch each other, except when they are chemically bonded. There is high electrostatic repulsion when two atoms come close together. This force is inversely proportional to the distance between them(squared). Thus, if they approach each other then the distance between them decreases and the repulsion increases. In chemical reactions, nuclear force comes into play and it neutralizes or overcomes the repulsion. Otherwise when the distance tends to zero(total touch), the repulsion reaches infinity.</p><p>Thus, a pure physical touch is not feasible. What is possible is merely a sensation of contact due to detected pressure from that object.</p><p>Enjoy a somewhat changed mind!</p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/authors/aditya-prakash/" class="invert" rel="author">Aditya Prakash</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at FactSet Research Systems. I like reading and exploring new things. Mention a new technology or a good book and I will try to know know about it more as soon as I can. Although I doen't usually finish all that I start, still the habit lets me increase my breadth of knowledge which I considers to be his goal for this life.<br><br>Being an introvert, I also like to spend thinking and speculating about all sorts of things, from software engineering to quantum physics, from astronomy to philosophy. This blog is an attempt to put my thoughts into words for the world to benefit and for myself too (lest I forget about the idea, haha!)</p><ul class="contact"><li class="icon solid fa-envelope">mail@aditya-prakash.com</li><li class="icon solid fa-home">India</li></ul></section><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">© Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
