It reads:</p><p><em>Certificates are worthless. I say that again: worthless! If you want to do any course, think whether you would still do that if there was no certificate. If yes, then go ahead otherwise there is no point doing that. And after the completion instead of posting your certificate post something you built during the course. Thatâ€™ll be worth much more. Happy learning!</em> ðŸ˜ƒ</p><p>I thought Iâ€™ll write down the reasons for my view. So here they are:</p><h4 id="measure-of-learning">Measure of learning?</h4><p>Some people think that its a measure of their learning. But I think the real measure of learning would be to apply that skill you learnt and create something which you can show to people instead of the certificate. I bet you Itâ€™ll give you much more confidence than the certificate and others also have an idea about what really you know, thus accomplishing the measurement of the skillset.</p><h4 id="opens-opportunities">Opens opportunities?</h4><p>Some people think that it helps them land good opportunities. I think most of the employers are now shifting towards giving priority to the skillset rather that the degree or certifications taken by the student. If people would think that certificates have some worth, there would be no tests/interviews whatsoever for any job. You would just had to provide certificates and get offer letter. haha.</p><p>But I think Iâ€™d be lying if I say employers donâ€™t look upon the certification section in your resume. But what Iâ€™m trying to say is only the certificate wont give you the job.</p><p>Now even if you are given an opportunity based on your certification, then also itâ€™d be hell for you in the real job if you had somehow passed/finished the course to get the certificate. Only skill can take you forward. Also I dont think there would be an employer who would ask for your certificate rather than your work which would give the real measure of your skill.</p><h4 id="the-real-issue">The Real issue</h4><p>There one more side to it. There are some people starting certification programs just for the sake of certification. And also there are some people who enroll in these programs just for the sake of certifications. They do it because they think there is some value in the certificates. And it is true to some extent. So they take the certificate and after some time realise that it had no value.</p><h4 id="the-solution">The Solution</h4><p>This will keep happening until we donâ€™t start looking down upon the certficates and looking up to the efforts put in the projects, however little it be.</p><p>This is my personal view but we need to discuss this as a community and try to reach a good solution for the issue (if it is really a issue ðŸ˜ƒ). So I thought Iâ€™d give it a little push.</p><h1></h1><h1 id="-1"></h1><p>At the end Iâ€™d like to point out that I too have a certificate (which I spent 4 years to get. yeah, my degree!ðŸ˜ƒ) in Electronics and Communicatin Engineering but I donâ€™t think I deserved that, given my skills in the field.</p><p>Also if you have any views please reach out to me on <a href="https://www.linkedin.com/in/prakash-aditya/">LinkedIn</a> or send me a mail at <a href="mailto:&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#64;&#x61;&#x64;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#x61;&#x2d;&#x70;&#114;&#x61;&#x6b;&#x61;&#115;&#x68;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;">&#x6d;&#97;&#x69;&#108;&#64;&#x61;&#x64;&#105;&#116;&#121;&#x61;&#x2d;&#x70;&#114;&#x61;&#x6b;&#x61;&#115;&#x68;&#46;&#99;&#x6f;&#109;</a></p></div><footer class="post__inner post__footer"><p class="post__last-updated">This article was updated on October 6, 2024</p><div class="post__share"><h3>Share post:</h3></div><div class="post__bio"><div><h3><a href="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/authors/aditya-prakash/" class="invert" rel="author">Aditya Prakash</a></h3></div></div></footer></article></div></div><div id="sidebar"><div class="inner"><nav id="menu"><header class="major"><h2>Menu</h2></header></nav><section><header class="major"><h2>Get in touch</h2></header><p>I am currently working as a Software Engineer at FactSet Research Systems. I like reading and exploring new things. Mention a new technology or a good book and I will try to know know about it more as soon as I can. Although I doen't usually finish all that I start, still the habit lets me increase my breadth of knowledge which I considers to be his goal for this life.<br><br>Being an introvert, I also like to spend thinking and speculating about all sorts of things, from software engineering to quantum physics, from astronomy to philosophy. This blog is an attempt to put my thoughts into words for the world to benefit and for myself too (lest I forget about the idea, haha!)</p><ul class="contact"><li class="icon solid fa-envelope">mail@aditya-prakash.com</li><li class="icon solid fa-home">India</li></ul></section><footer id="footer"><p class="copyright">Â© Editorial 2 - All rights reserved<br>Design by: <a href="https://html5up.net" target="_blank" rel="noopener">HTML5 UP</a>, Powered by Publii</p></footer></div></div></div><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/jquery.min.js?v=7c14a783dfeb3d238ccd3edd840d82ee"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/browser.min.js?v=c07298dd19048a8a69ad97e754dfe8d0"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/breakpoints.min.js?v=81a479eb099e3b187613943b085923b8"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/util.min.js?v=cbdaf7c20ac2883c77ae23acfbabd47e"></script><script src="https://prakash-aditya.github.io/my-blog/assets/js/main.min.js?v=08add7f6d435054ad38ec38d7cf8be40"></script><script>var images=document.querySelectorAll("img[loading]");for(var i=0;i<images.length;i++){if(images[i].complete){images[i].classList.add("is-loaded")}else{images[i].addEventListener("load",function(){this.classList.add("is-loaded")},false)}};</script></body></html>
